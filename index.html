			Breaking Bad follows protagonist Walter White <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bryan_Cranston">(Bryan Cranston)</a></i>,
			a chemistry teacher who lives in New Mexico with his wife <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Gunn">(Anna Gunn)</a></i> and teenage son (RJ Mitte) who has cerebral palsy.
			White is diagnosed with Stage III cancer and given
			a prognosis of two years left to live. With a new sense
			of fearlessness based on his medical prognosis, and a desire
			to secure his family's financial security, White chooses to
			enter a dangerous world of drugs and crime and ascends to power
			in this world. The series explores how a fatal diagnosis such as
			White's releases a typical man from the daily concerns and constraints
			of normal society and follows his transformation from mild family man
			to a kingpin of the drug trade.
